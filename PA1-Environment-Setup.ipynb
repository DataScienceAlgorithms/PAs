    "Write a program (`pa1.py`) that opens a data file called [tv_shows.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney). This file contains \"the data scraped comprises a comprehensive list of tv shows available on various streaming platforms.\" It has the following columns (AKA attributes):\n",
    "1. Unique TV show ID\n",
    "1. Title\n",
    "1. Year: The year in which the tv show was produced\n",
    "1. Age: Target age group\n",
    "1. IMDb: IMDb rating\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Load the data**\n",
    "1. Define/call a function that loads the TV shows data into a 2D Python list (AKA table).\n",
    "2.  Remove (and store) the first row, which contains the header of table.\n",
    "3.  You may use Python‚Äôs built-in csv module (recommended), or write the parsing from scratch.\n",
    "    1. Note: you can use the [`csv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) to help with file I/O if you'd like (but if you want to write it from scratch, see the bonus below!)\n",

    "1. Q4: How many TV shows are rated for the ‚Äú18+‚Äù age group?\n",
